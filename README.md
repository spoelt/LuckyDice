# LuckyDice

## Overview

LuckyDice is a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) app that enables users to play Dice Poker and Yahtzee ⚠️ (Note: Yahtzee is still under development). This project is designed for both Android and iOS and uses Compose Multiplatform to enable sharing UI components. The iOS functionality is still untested, however, and will be verified once I get my new MacBook. At this point, only the Android implementation has been tested manually.
